# About this library

This  __C++__ library provides a framework to create BehaviorTrees.
It was designed to be flexible, easy to use and fast.

Even if our main use-case is __robotics__, you can use this library to build
__AI for games__, or to replace Finite State Machines in you application.

__BehaviorTree.CPP__ has many interesting features, when compared to other implementations:

- It makes asynchronous Actions, i.e. non-blocking, a first-class citizen.
- It allows the creation of trees at run-time, using a textual representation (XML).
- You can link staticaly you custom TreeNodes or convert them into plugins 
which are loaded at run-time.
- It includes a __logging/profiling__ infrastructure that allows the user 
to visualize, record, replay and analyze state transitions.
